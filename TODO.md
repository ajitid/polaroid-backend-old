- post thumbnail deletion
- user profile pic api endpoint and imagekit conversion


- simplify things like
```
if (request.method in ("PUT", "PATCH")) and (self.kwargs["username"] != request.user.username):
```
by using api/users/self
rather than api/users/ajitid and using the above condition as then they will be simplified to
just read requests
^ this is still debatable as this doesn't solves deleting comment or posts plus we are breaking consistency for just one case
